# How to Create Brand Guidelines for Your Small Business

Your brand is inconsistent. Sometimes your logo is blue, sometimes navy. Your website uses one font, your social media uses another. Every piece of content looks like it came from a different company.

Sound familiar? You need brand guidelines.

Brand guidelines (also called a brand style guide or brand book) are the rulebook for how your brand looks, sounds, and feels. They ensure consistency across everything you create — whether it's you, an employee, a contractor, or an agency doing the work.

This guide shows you how to create professional brand guidelines even if you're not a designer.

## What Are Brand Guidelines (And Why Do You Need Them)?

Brand guidelines document:
- How your logo should be used
- What colors represent your brand
- Which fonts to use where
- How your brand communicates
- The overall visual style

### Why They Matter:

1. **Consistency builds recognition** — Customers remember brands that look the same everywhere
2. **Professionalism** — Inconsistency looks amateur; consistency looks established
3. **Efficiency** — No more "what color should I use?" decisions
4. **Quality control** — Anyone following the guidelines produces on-brand work
5. **Scale** — You can delegate design work confidently

Even a simple 3-page brand guide beats having nothing.

## What to Include in Your Brand Guidelines

### 1. Logo Usage

Your logo section should cover:

**Primary logo:**
- The main version of your logo
- Color variations (full color, single color, reversed)
- When to use each version

**Clear space:**
- Minimum space around the logo (usually defined as "X height of the logo")
- What can't appear in that space

**Minimum size:**
- Smallest acceptable size (for print and digital)
- Ensures legibility

**Don'ts:**
- Don't stretch or distort
- Don't change colors
- Don't add effects (shadows, gradients)
- Don't place on busy backgrounds without contrast
- Don't rotate

### 2. Color Palette

Define your brand colors precisely:

**Primary colors:**
- 1-2 main colors used most frequently
- Include: HEX, RGB, CMYK, and Pantone codes

**Secondary colors:**
- Supporting colors for accents
- Same format as primary

**Neutral colors:**
- Background, text, and UI colors
- Usually black, white, and grays

**Usage ratios:**
- Example: "60% primary, 30% secondary, 10% accent"
- Prevents overwhelming or unbalanced designs

**Accessibility:**
- Ensure sufficient contrast between text and background colors
- Test combinations for accessibility (WCAG AA standard minimum)

### 3. Typography

Specify fonts for different uses:

**Primary typeface:**
- For headings, titles, and emphasis
- Include: font name, weights (Bold, Medium, Regular), and where to get it

**Secondary typeface:**
- For body text and longer reading
- Usually a highly legible serif or sans-serif

**Font hierarchy:**
- H1: Primary font, 32px, Bold
- H2: Primary font, 24px, Medium
- Body: Secondary font, 16px, Regular
- Caption: Secondary font, 12px, Regular

**Web-safe alternatives:**
- If your primary font isn't available, what substitutes are acceptable?

**Don'ts:**
- Don't use other fonts
- Don't stretch or compress
- Minimum sizes for readability

### 4. Imagery Style

Guide visual content selection:

**Photography style:**
- Bright and airy? Dark and moody? Candid or staged?
- Subject matter (people, products, landscapes)
- Filters or treatments (if any)

**Illustrations:**
- Style (flat, 3D, hand-drawn)
- Color treatment (use brand colors?)
- When to use vs. photography

**Icons:**
- Style (outlined, filled, rounded)
- Stroke weights
- Source library (if using a consistent set)

**What to avoid:**
- Clichéd stock photos
- Inconsistent styles
- Low-quality images

### 5. Voice and Tone

Your brand's personality in words:

**Brand voice:**
- Describe in 3-5 adjectives: "Friendly, professional, and straightforward"
- How you always sound, regardless of context

**Tone variations:**
- How tone shifts by context:
  - Customer support: Empathetic and helpful
  - Marketing: Energetic and inspiring
  - Legal/official: Clear and precise

**Writing examples:**
- "We say: 'Get started in minutes'"
- "We don't say: 'Commence your journey'"

**Grammar and style:**
- Oxford comma? Yes/no
- Contractions? Usually acceptable
- Brand name capitalization: "BrandSnap" not "Brandsnap" or "BRANDSNAP"

### 6. Application Examples

Show the guidelines in action:

**Business cards**
**Email signatures**
**Social media profiles and posts**
**Website screenshots**
**Presentation templates**
**Marketing materials**

Visual examples make abstract rules concrete.

## Creating Your Brand Guidelines: Step by Step

### Step 1: Gather Existing Assets

Collect everything you currently have:
- Logo files (all versions)
- Color codes you've been using
- Fonts in use on your website
- Marketing materials you like
- Competitor examples for reference

### Step 2: Document Your Logo Rules

- Export your logo in multiple formats (SVG, PNG, PDF)
- Create color variations
- Define clear space and minimum sizes
- Write out the "don'ts"

### Step 3: Lock in Your Colors

- If you don't have defined colors, choose them now
- Use tools like Coolors or Adobe Color for palette generation
- Get precise codes for each color
- Test accessibility with contrast checkers

### Step 4: Select Your Fonts

- Choose a display font (personality, headings)
- Choose a body font (readability, long text)
- Ensure both are web-safe or available via Google Fonts / Adobe Fonts
- Define the hierarchy

### Step 5: Define Your Visual Style

- Choose 5-10 example images that represent your brand
- Write descriptions of what makes them right
- Note what to avoid

### Step 6: Write Your Voice Guidelines

- Describe your brand personality
- Give examples of how you write
- Include dos and don'ts

### Step 7: Assemble the Document

Use a simple format:
- PDF for sharing (most common)
- Web page for easy updates
- Notion/Confluence for internal teams

Keep it scannable — designers will reference it quickly, not read it cover to cover.

## Brand Guidelines Template Structure

Here's a simple 10-page structure:

1. **Cover page** — Brand name and "Brand Guidelines"
2. **Introduction** — What this document is and who it's for
3. **Logo** — Primary, variations, clear space, don'ts
4. **Colors** — Palette with codes and usage guidance
5. **Typography** — Fonts, hierarchy, examples
6. **Imagery** — Photo/illustration style with examples
7. **Voice and tone** — Personality, examples, don'ts
8. **Applications** — How everything comes together
9. **Assets and resources** — Where to find files
10. **Contact** — Who to ask for help

You don't need 100 pages. A clear, concise guide beats an exhaustive one nobody reads.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Too vague** — "Use nice colors" helps no one. Be specific.
2. **Too rigid** — Leave room for creativity within boundaries
3. **Never updating** — Brands evolve. Review guidelines annually
4. **Not sharing** — Guidelines nobody sees are useless
5. **Skipping examples** — Show, don't just tell

- Canva (easiest for non-designers)
- Figma (more control, still accessible)
- Adobe InDesign (professional)
